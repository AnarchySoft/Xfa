    XfaTP (revision 1.0)
 ==========================

1. PREAMBLE

  The Xfa Tranfer Protocol (abbr. XfaTP) is a protocol designed to facilitate the
  direct exchange of Xfa fragments via the Internet. It requires no intermediate
  server for hosting the files and no P2P connection, as a singular connection between
  the host machine and the client machine are sufficient for a successful exchange.

2. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

  The protocol may only work reliably and securely if the integrity of the host can
  be guaranteed. For this reason, Xfa index files with XfaTP features enabled need
  to be digitally signed with the PGP key of the host. The same PGP key must be used
  to establish the connection between host and client. If the PGP signature during
  the handshake does not match, the client is obligated to reject the connection.

  There is the possibility to create a joined signature directory, which allows any
  party that belongs to a signature in the directory to establish the connection. In
  this case, the handshake will not fail. The signature directory itself has to be
  signed with the key of the primary host, as to prevent any modifications to the
  directory after creation.

  It is possible to import or export address books of truested parties, which may be
  embedded into new indexes by default, as to allow any trusted party to redistribute
  fragments and thereby help increase download speeds or fragment availability. This
  is usually only helpful for publicly shared index files.

  The hashes of each downloaded fragment will be verified as usual and the download is
  only considered successful if the hash sums in the index match. Xfa allows cross-index
  fragment downloads, meaning if a fragment in any index matches the hash sum of the
  desired index, it may be used instead of the one linked by the original index. This is
  true under the assumption that every distinct fragment yields a unique hash sum, and
  that two fragments with equal hash sums are equivalent. Said rule is only discarded in
  case the file lengths do not match, as this may indicate an intentional denial-of-service
  attack, functionally equivalent to a zip bomb.
